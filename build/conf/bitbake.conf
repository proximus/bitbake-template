#
#   DESCRIPTION: This is the first thing BitBake must find in order to build a
#                target and is located using the BBPATH variable. The
#                conf/bitbake.conf includes a number of configuration variables
#                BitBake uses for metadata and recipe files. It may also include
#                other configuration files using the include or require
#                directives for modularity.

# Establish a directory that BitBake uses for build output and intermediate
# files. You can always safely delete the tmp directory in order to rebuild a
# BitBake target. The build process creates the directory for you when you run
# BitBake. TOPDIR points to the build directory. BitBake automatically sets this
# variable.
TMPDIR = "${TOPDIR}/tmp"

# Specify the directory BitBake uses to store a cache of the metadata so it
# does not need to be parsed every time BitBake is started.
CACHE  = "${TMPDIR}/cache"

# Specify the base path used to create recipe stamp files. The path to an actual
# stamp file is constructed by evaluating this string and then appending
# additional information.
STAMP  = "${TMPDIR}/stamps"

# Point to a directory were BitBake places temporary files, which consist mostly
# of task logs and scripts, when building a particular recipe.
T      = "${TMPDIR}/work"

# The directory in which BitBake executes functions during a recipe's build
# process.
B      = "${TMPDIR}"
