#
#   DESCRIPTION:  BitBake first searches the current working directory for an
#                 optional conf/bblayers.conf configuration file to determine
#                 what layers BitBake needs to recognize. This file is expected
#                 to contain a BBLAYERS variable that is a space-delimited list
#                 of 'layer' directories. If there is no bblayers.conf file,
#                 then it is assumed the user has set the BBPATH and BBFILES
#                 variables directly in the environment.

# The BBPATH bitbakes key variable is used to search for configuration and class
# files under the conf and classes directories, respectively. TOPDIR points to
# the build directory and is set automatically by BitBake. The ":=" operator
# results in a variable's contents being expanded immediately, rather than when
# the variable is actually used.
BBPATH := "${TOPDIR}"

# Define BBLAYERS as a list of layers to enable during the build. If BBLAYERS is
# undefined and already has a value when the statement is parsed, then leave the
# value alone. This assignment is immediate.
BBLAYERS ?= " \
